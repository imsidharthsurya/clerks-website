      <h1 class="text-center">Response to Todd Nation</h1>
      <hr>
      <span>
          <p class="text-justify">
            There has been a lot of information given by my opponent, Todd Nation and I feel I have a duty to respond. I’m not going to allow someone to keep making false statements about me, my family or my staff and get away with it. It’s time for the people to know the facts.
            <br/><br/>
            I started my “tax payer funded position” when I joined the US Army back in 1991. 
            I proudly served my country until I was Honorably Discharged in 1995. I am the only veteran in the race for Vigo County Clerk. I have chosen a career in law enforcement because public service is in my blood, it’s who I am, and something I’m proud of. 
            I have been a police officer for over 16 years and am proud to serve and protect our community. 
            I had a goal of being promoted to Sergeant in which I have obtained, having served as a shift supervisor and eventually being chosen to supervise the juvenile crimes investigative unit, overseeing investigations involving our most precious and vulnerable assets, children. 
            I often work various hours, sacrificing time with my own family to ensure that the duties I am responsible for as a police officer and Vigo County Clerk are not neglected.  I am goal oriented, and thus far have achieved every goal I set out to achieve with both positions. I embrace the different challenges that come with each position and have succeeded in every aspect.  My opponent, Todd Nation can cite no evidence that my holding two government jobs has, in any way, negatively impacted the Clerk’s Office. I find it disgusting that Nation insults the idea of people working two jobs to provide for their family. My wife also holds a “taxpayer funded position” as a School Teacher! I am very proud of her public service and her drive to make Vigo County a better place for our youth.  I was elected four years ago to improve the Vigo County Clerk’s Office and have worked diligently to make that happen. 
            I am happy to report that our Clerk’s office is more efficient and cost effective than it has ever been! 
            While Mr. Nation criticizes me for stepping up, choosing public service, and for helping make Vigo County an all-around better place, I will focus on making Terre Haute safer, and maintaining the respect and efficiency our Clerk’s office has built. 
            Our Vigo County Clerk’s office is routinely sought out by other Clerk’s office for guidance on how we operate so efficiently and effectively. 
            In fact, the Vigo County Clerk’s office was the only Clerks office in the country to offer real time cleaning and sanitization of polling locations during the primary when Covid-19 was at its peak, giving voters the peace of mind to be able to vote in person. 
            This is only one example of the innovative and forward thinking that has been implemented during my time as Your Vigo County Clerk.
            <br/><br/>
            Mr. Nation makes numerous misleading statements, one of which being that if elected, he will resign from his position as Terre Haute City Councilman at the end of the year. Of course he will. This is required by law, he’s not making some big sacrifice for the people, not at all. He never has and he never will. He has to by law. This statement is deceptive for the purpose of showing contrast between our candidacies; that’s not good for Vigo County.
            <br/><br/>
            Mr. Nation falsely claims that we hired RJL Solutions to handle media inquiries. Wrong again Mr. Nation. RJL Solutions was hired for a PR campaign, with the focus being on improving voter turnout and educating voters. They are a great organization which has advocated for our community when many of our own elected officials failed to do so. RJL Solutions has been involved in projects such as the casino, the downtown convention center and other upcoming investments in our community, the same progress that Todd himself tried to stop but simply couldn’t, changing his mind only after realizing that the constituents of Vigo County truly wanted to see progress.  Todd and his associates are always negative I choose to be positive with everything.  Those who know me know I am a very high energy, positive person who laughs loud and laugh often.
            <br/><br/>     
            Mr. Nation criticized me for requesting a full time “Election Director” position from the Vigo County Council. What he doesn’t tell you is this position would be in lieu of a large portion of the cost that we currently pay our election consulting firm. Essentially saving the county upwards of 60 thousand dollars a year, and that’s with full time benefits. Again, very misleading. Again Todd is old school politics. He and his family, along with the Burkes, the Gambills and the Williams believe it’s their divine right to control political positions here in Vigo County. This county is better than that and has proven in the last election that it doesn’t want that kind of leadership or cronyism. Furthermore, the divide that some of these people has caused in the local Democrat Party is disheartening to everyone. I truly believe that good people exist on both sides of the aisle. Unfortunately the extreme liberal left has tried to hijack that party. 
            <br/><br/>  
            Mr. Nation has no idea of the amount of hours, or the commitment I have put into my “tax payer funded” positions. For Todd to even state that having two full time positions can’t be done, I would ask him to look no further than his own sister Tonya Pfaff, who holds two “tax payer funded positions.” Is it equally wrong that she made $68,164.32 in 2019 as a State Representative and an additional $53,647.15 as a teacher with the Vigo County School Corporation. Right? And that doesn’t even take into account what it cost the taxpayers to pay for a substitute teacher on the days she couldn’t attend school because she was gone. Seems very hypocritical to me. How about you? People in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones. Another example of Todd being “Negative Nation.”
            <br/><br/>   
            Here are some positives that we have accomplished in the Clerk’s office since I have become your Vigo County Clerk.
            <br/><br/>
            The very first thing I did was bring in a very strong and talented Chief Deputy in Leanna Moore. By the way, Leanna was a lifelong Democrat and I knew this when I hired her. She was the right person for the job. She still is! Second thing I did was appoint Joyce Raley as my office manager. She too is a lifelong Democrat. Both are very classy women. I will speak more about Joyce later but know this these are two of the strongest most talented people in county government. Both Democrats demonstrating that I not only respect the Democrat Party but work closely with them each and every day. All of the judges I work with are Democrat and it proves that the two can co-exist and have mutual respect for one another.  It doesn’t seem to me that Nation understands this nor does he want to. I choose to make my decisions based merit and treat people and how they treat others not based on what initial they have in front of their name. I’ve ran the Clerk’s office in a very a-political manner and have taken politics out of the Clerk’s office.  There’s much to tell about all of the positives and excellent accomplishments we have made in the Clerk’s office.  But the Trib-Star never focuses on those because it’s a left wing newspaper who adds their twist to everything they cover and caters to the liberal left extremist. Fact!
            <br/><br/>
            One of the first things I did in office was implementing a new professional dress code. I explained that every day we work with professionals and we will dress like professionals. On Fridays, the staff is permitted to wear jeans in good taste, in exchange for their voluntary donation of $5.00 which is donated each quarter to a charity of their choosing. Since the inception of the jeans fund we have given away literally thousands of dollars. We still do this today, and the staff enjoys it, particularly around Christmas when we reach out to families in need.
            <br/><br/>
            Another accomplishment was the reorganization of the organizational chart of the office. The organizational chart was drastically outdated and in large part ignored, causing disorganization and dysfunction. We had some supervisors trying to supervise 18 people and then another only supervising 3 employees. Since then, we have supervisors and assistant supervisors proportionate to the employees being supervised. This was a dramatic improvement in efficiency within the Clerk’s office. We also implemented a semiannual evaluation system. We can’t expect people/employees to improve without some type of gauge for performance, as well as expectations.  This really helped with communication within the office.  I have also challenged the leadership team with different books to read in hopes of broadening their horizons, and with each book I suggested, the message was about being positive, setting goals and leadership. This has been met with open arms. Now, I have to come up with new books all the time because they continuously seek self-improvement. That’s probably something I think about a lot with my staff. It’s a great problem to have.
            <br/><br/>
            The next task was to bring the Vigo County Clerks Office into this 21st century with technology and protocols that are consistent with efficiency and better for everyone from the top down. I know that some people won’t understand this but we needed to make government more user friendly. When I took office the Clerk’s office was a cash-only office. That’s ridiculous. No one carries cash anymore.  So, after researching companies who supported government accounts, I met with three companies. My whole goal was that none of the cost associated with using credit card/debit card machines should be passed on to the taxpayer. Those fees should be paid upfront by the user. We arrived on an agreement with the company and we had credit card machines installed at the jail for bail payments. We had them installed in book keeping for child support, marriage licenses, fines and fees. We also had one installed in the front office, again at no cost to the taxpayer.  
            In keeping with that same ideology, we converted the entire court system to E-File prior to other counties in the state. There is no reason why we should not embrace technology that can make everyone’s life easier.  I reached out to the state and asked that they train our staff on E-File. We have again improved efficiency and turnaround time for filings and the different aspects of each court case.
            <br/><br/>
            I began studying the financial books and noticed that there was a lot of money on the books of uncollected fines and fees (annual support fees), of which the farthest back that I can collect, by law, was 2011. So, again at no cost to the taxpayer, I hired a company to do collections and we collected upwards of $25,000.00 in fines and fees. Some of which went into the general fund because it was owed to the county.
            <br/><br/>  
            I also looked at the money that we have sitting in escrow. I wanted to put that money in a Jumbo CD and apply the interest towards the county general fund. 
            I have attached a copy of my Clerk New Income and Savings document. PLEASE TAKE LOOK AT IT!  The return on those investments again contributing to the general fund was upwards of $46,370.63 over the last four years.  This was pure profit and money earned off those CD’s from money that was just sitting there. Again just doing my part to lessen the burden on taxpayers.
            <br/><br/>
            Instead of just getting rid of old election scanners that we no longer use, I reached out to other clerks and sold them at a discount to a county that could use them. Again, putting money back into the general fund.
            <br/><br/>
            During this same time I started studying who voted and the different voter demographics. I realized that younger voter turnout was less than impressive. I couldn’t figure out why, so I reached out to the student government at Indiana State University, invited them and a bunch of high school students to my office for doughnuts and a round table discussion about why they weren’t voting. It was a simple answer. They didn’t know how and no one had ever explained how to use the machines, how important democracy is or the value of the vote. This sent me into orbit as you can probably imagine. I called a meeting with the school superintendent here in Vigo County and his leadership team (Principals). I explained what I had learned and I proposed this. I wanted to come in twice a year and explain about voting. I wanted them to be hands on and not intimidated by the process. So, I offered to do their class elections on our machines, and I also wanted to do mock elections so that they can familiarize themselves with the technology. I mean these kids are way ahead of us as adults with technology. We have had to learn it, they grew up with it.  The superintendent loved it and gave his full support. The principals couldn’t wait and we have done this every year since my second year in office. WINNING!  At the same time, I reached out to ISU, Rose Hulman Institute of Technology, and Saint Mary of The Woods and helped get them all on board. That was a little more complicated but it has proven to be very beneficial. Results don’t lie…..I have increased voter participation in every election.
            <br/><br/>
            Which is a great interlude to improving voter turnout and the voter experience. I didn’t like how long it took from start to finish to vote, so I held mock elections at the Vigo County Courthouse and the Vigo County Public Library. We timed each different set up inside the voting centers so that we could improve the overall experience of the voter. I also bought electronic e-poll books which also reduced the chances of voter fraud. I asked that Voter Registration clean up the voter registry here in Vigo County, and they did. The days of people voting from their caskets are over. The state has been helpful with this but needs to remove the red tape. That’s a whole different conversation for a later date. I reached out to a local PR team (RJL Solutions) to get the word out about where when and why to vote, why your vote matters. This has been a very successful venture and continues as we speak. Again I have increased voter participation and education. This has been a win-win for everyone involved.  Also, I had yard signs printed to Vote Early and we embarked on trying to spread the word on voting early so that on Election Day there would be less of a burden on everyone. Another success. Each year we have continued to add early voting locations that are geographically convenient throughout the county, and it has paid dividends. 
            <br/><br/> 
            And by the way, I have done more with less money each year when it comes to elections. I keep getting beat up by my opponent who continuously makes half-true statements. He seems to pick and choose what he wants to throw out to the public. It’s very obvious he knows NOTHING about the functions and the day to day operations of the Clerk’s office.  Just being Negative Nation.
            <br/><br/>
            Let’s move on to other things. I applied for a security grant through the Indiana Secretary of State’s Office for our election equipment. No one from the Vigo County Clerk’s office had EVER applied for a grant. Again, trying to lessen the burden on the taxpayers. We were successful and received the grant. It gave us the ability to update security at the building that houses the election equipment. After all it’s an old highway garage so it needed a lot of upgrades. The grant ($51,243.00) accomplished our goal! Again, at NO cost to the taxpayer. 
            <br/><br/>
            I thought it was a waste of money to have to pay Brinks Security come and take the daily drop to the bank when we have the Vigo County Sheriff’s Department right next door. After researching, I found that it was more of the “good ole boy system” and that’s why Brinks was hired in the first place. I spoke with the Sheriff, who agreed that it was a waste of money and that our own Vigo County Sheriff’s Department would escort our employees to the bank with the daily drop. Which is a lot safer than a Brinks Truck. Sheriff’s deputies have direct contact with Vigo County Central Dispatch if, God forbid, anything would ever go wrong. It would be an immediate response with the proper response.  This would eliminate have to go through multiple layers before officers would be alerted and responding to the call. Anyway, by getting rid of Brinks we saved the taxpayers $27,888.00 to date.
            <br/><br/>  
            Another thing that we eliminated is Quench water. The county had been in an auto renewing contract with Quench for year. No one payed any attention to it. I reviewed it and discovered that I can save the county money by getting our local Culligan affiliate to provide water coolers and jugs of water. This saved the tax payer $6,336.00 during my four year term. Let’s put that into perspective over 6 thousand dollars on water. Nonsense!
            <br/><br/> 
            In case you haven’t noticed, we have treated the taxpayers money within the Clerk’s office the same way I would run my personal checking account. I have made decisions on what is in the best interest of the taxpayers. To date, I have generated or saved the taxpayers of Vigo County over $244,000.00 during my term as the Vigo County Clerk. That’s huge number and everyone in the clerk’s office should be applauded for that. 
            <br/><br/> 
            During the Covid outbreak, I had to come up with a way for people to vote, in a safe and sanitary environment. I reached out to Serv-Pro to clean the polling locations in real time, ensuring voter safety and giving them the peace of mind knowing that voting locations are safe and sanitary. I can go on and on about the things we have accomplished. I say we because my staff is amazing. Anyone who thinks that they can do this all by themselves is fooling themselves. It can’t be done.
            <br/><br/>
            And I will close with this. Speaking of my staff. I nominated my office manager (Joyce Raley) for the State of Indiana Lifetime Achievement Award. Which she deservingly won and I take pride in that. She is the backbone of our office and when she leaves in a year or so I will be better off for the opportunity of getting to know her and her family. She’s wonderful!
            <br/><br/>
            These are just a few examples of the progress made in the last four years. And we will make even more progress in the next four years.
            <br/><br/>
            Sincerely,
            <br/><br/>
